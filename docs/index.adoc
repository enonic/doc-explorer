== Introduction

Explorer is an enterprise search application that supports collecting, and searching across data from different sources.

NOTE: tl;dr - visit the <<start#,getting started section>>.

These are the core concepts of Explorer:

* <<admin/schema#, Schema>> represent a common set of fields across different sources
* <<admin/collections#, Collections>> enable storing data from a specific source.
* <<collectors#, Collectors>> are pluggable apps that extract and fill data into collections
* Collectors can be configured and scheduled
* <<admin/thesauri#, Thesauri>> and <<admin/stopwords#, Stop word>> lists can be created and managed for improved search results
* <<admin/interfaces#, Search inferfaces>> can be tuned and managed to optimise search results

Finally, explorer provides an <<api#, search API>> that can be used to implement <<clients#, fully customized search interfaces>> for end users.
