== Introduction

Collect, index and search across multiple different datasources with Explorer.

NOTE: tl;dr - visit the <<start#,getting started>> section.

These are the core concepts of Explorer:

* <<collections#, Collections>> Each collection may hold a set of data, typically from a specific source.
* <<collectors#, Collectors>> are Enonic apps that can retrive and fill data into collections, based on events or via scheduling
* <<doctypes#, Document types>> define fields and how to index them for search.
* <<synonyms#, Synonyms>> and <<stopwords#, Stop word>> lists can be created and managed for improved search results.
* <<interfaces#, Inferfaces>> - Allows search admins to compose and tune search across collections
