== Introduction

Explorer is an enterprise search application that supports collecting, and searching across data from different sources. 

NOTE: In a hurry? Visit the <<start#,Getting started section>>.

These are the core concepts of Explorer:

* Properties represent a common set of fields across different sources
* Collections enable storing data from a single source
* <<collectors#, Collectors>> are pluggable apps that extract and fill data into collections
* Collectors can be configured and scheduled
* Thesauri and stopword lists can be created and managed for improved search results
* Search inferfaces can be tuned and managed to optimise search results

Finally, explorer provides an <<api#, search API>> that can be used to implement <<clients#, fully customized search interfaces>> for end users.
