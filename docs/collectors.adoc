== Introduction

A collectors can be configured to extract data from a specific source, and returns the content to explorer for indexing.

== Usage

=== Install

To make use of a collector, you must first make sure it is installed. Collectors are typically distributed as regular XP applications, but Explorer also ships with a standard collector called <<webcrawler#, webcrawler>>.

=== Configure

To make use of a collector, you must first create a collection, then choose the specific collector and configure it.

All items returned from the collector will then be stored and indexed in the specific collection.

=== Run
For each collection, Explorer will run the specified collector as a background job. The jobs follow the defined schedule of the collection.

== Custom collectors
Explorer enables development of custom collectors. Follow these instructions to build your own <<custom#, custom collector>>.
