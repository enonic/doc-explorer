NOTE: Explorer requires Enonic XP in order to run. It can also be tested on a local developer environment.

== Installation

To get started, simply install Explorer to your XP instance. Explorer is available from https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/explorer[Enonic market].

=== Configuration

To activate scheduling, add the following configuration file.

WARNING: If you are running an XP cluster, only one of the nodes must have this configuration. Running collector jobs on multiple nodes can trigger race conditions.

.XP_HOME/config/com.enonic.app.explorer.cfg
[source,java]
----
cron = true #Default is false
----


== Explorer admin

From the XP admin console, you should now be able to access the <<admin#, explorer admin>>, via a fresh entry in the XP menu.
