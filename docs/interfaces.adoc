== Introduction

Your collected data can be exposed by defining search interfaces.

Each search interface allows you to select which collections and synonyms to combine,
as well as the ability to tune and boost your search down to the field level.

== Interface list

From the interface list you may perform regular actions, but it additionally offers two custom actions for `Trying` it out:

* A *[Search]* button, to test the interface.
* A *[GraphQL]* button, to test the API directly.


== Interface options

When creating, or editing interfaces, these are the available options you may manage:

Name:: Each interface needs a unique name, which is also the identifier
+
NOTE: Once created, the name cannot be changed.

Collections:: You need to specify at least one collection to include in the search.

Fields:: Select which fields should be used when searching and optionally add field boosting.

Stop-words:: The search string is split, by unicode boundaries, into words, then each word matching a stop word will be removed from the search string.
+
Stop-words are applied before the synonym stage.
+
CAUTION: Be careful when adding stop words, it may quickly lead to an empty search string and no search results.

Synonyms:: Optionally add one ore more thesauri. They will be used to "decorate" the query, and hopefully provide better results.
+
First any <<#_stop_words, Stop-words>> are removed,
then the remaining search string is used to query for synonyms,
matches are used to decorate the main query.
