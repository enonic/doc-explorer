== Introduction

Use collections to gather and manage <<documents#, documents>>. Documents can be injected externally through the API, or actively fetched by a collector.

== Options

When creating and editing a collection, these are the common fiels of a collector and their purpose.

Name:: Specify a unique name for the collection. This name is also an identifier, and cannot be changed once the collection has been saved.

Default language:: Optionally specify a default language for the collection. This will be used to optimize indexing and search in the collection through the use of stemming.

Collector:: Optionally select a collector. Collectors are background jobs that are used to fetch data from external sources, and add them as <<documents#, documents>> to this collection.

TIP: You can build your own custom collector or find existing collectors on https://market.enonic.com/applications[Enonic Market].


=== Collector config

If you selected a collector, it will optionally present you with configuration options through a new set of form fields.

The fields will be custom to the specific collector.

=== Collector schedule

If you selected a collector, you may optionally define schedule(s) to automatically run the collector.

NOTE: Note that the scheduler should be allowed to finish before it is triggered again. Only one instance of the collector will be running at a time.

=== Run collector manually

Clicking the `Collect` icon from the Collections list view will manually trigger the collector job.


== Status

Status is a sub-item in the Collections menu. Status will be visible if there are any collectors actively running.

NOTE: For the e-mail notification to work, your Enonic XP deployment must be configured with an e-mail gateway.

The schedule provides a global view of all collector jobs scheduled to run. This helps you plan execution and resource management optimally.
