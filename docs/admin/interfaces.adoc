When you have collected some data it's time to provide some search interfaces.

== New / edit

Each interface needs a unique name.

Then you can select which collection(s) you want to search in.

== Filters

You can set up some must and mustNot filters to avoid search results that don't meet the required quality.
For instance it's normally useful that a search result actually has an uri so it can be navigated to.

== Query

You may configure a simple fulltext query, or group multiple expressions together using a logic expression.
Combining a boosted fulltext query, with a ngram and synonym query can be a good idea.

Each <<synonyms,synonym>> is stored in a <<thesauri,thesaurus>>.

== Stop-words

See <<stop_words_2,below>>.

== Result mapping

Here you can configure which <<fields,fields>> are provided to the frontend and do some simple data manipulation.
