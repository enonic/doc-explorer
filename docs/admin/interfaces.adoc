== Introduction

Your collected data can be exposed by defining search interfaces. Essentially, a search interface allows you to select which collections and thesauri to combine, as well as the ability to tune and boost your search down to field level.

== Basics

Each interface needs a unique name.

Additionally, you need to specify at least one collection to include in the search.

== Filters

You can define must and mustNot filters to avoid search results that don't meet the required quality.
For instance it's normally useful that a search result actually has an uri so it can be navigated to.

== Query

You may configure a simple fulltext query, or group multiple expressions together using a logic expression.
Combining a boosted fulltext query, with a ngram and synonym query can be a good idea.
