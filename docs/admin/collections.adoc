== Introduction

This is where you configure how and when to collect data into a collection.

In order to do that you first need to install a <<collector#, Collector>>.

You can develop your own collector or install one from https://market.enonic.com/applications[Enonic market].

=== New / Edit

Each collection needs a unique name and a collector.

Selecting a language, makes it possible to use stemmed search.

You can configure multiple cron schedules and select whether to collect at all.
