This is where you configure how and when to collect data into a collection.

In order to do that you first need to install a link:collector[].

You can develop your own link:collector[] or install one from https://market.enonic.com/applications[Enonic market].

=== New / Edit

Each collection needs a unique name and a link:collector[].
