:toc: right

== Introduction

In order to configure "who" can access what. An admin can manage API-keys.


== New/Edit

=== Name

An API-key must have a unique name. Once an API-key is created you cannot change it's name.

=== Key

When you first create a new API-key, the key field will contain an autogenerated key, if you don't like it, you can click the generate key button for a new one, or simply enter one yourself.

CAUTION: The key (in it's original form) is never stored anywhere, so *make sure to remember it* :)

WARNING: If you forget it, you can provide a [lime]*new* one later, the [red]*old* one will then [red]*stop working*!

=== Collections

You can select which collection(s) an api-key is valid for. If you add a collection here, you can CRUD to it using the <<../api/document#, Document REST API>>.

=== Interfaces

You can select which interface(s) an api-key is valid for. If you add an interface here, you can read from it using the <<../api/interface#, Interface GraphQL API>>.
