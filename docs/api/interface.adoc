= Interface GraphQL API
:toc: right
:toclevels: 4

== Setup

=== Authorization

In order to access the *Document REST API* you must first create an <<../admin/apiKeys#, API-Key>>.

Then you must provide that API-key in the *Authorization* header when you do any http request against the API.

For example if you have an API-key with the key "mySecretKey", the Authorization header must look like this:

 Authorization: Explorer-Api-Key mySecretKey

=== vhost configuration

.com.enonic.xp.web.vhost.cfg
[source,cfg]
----
enabled = true

mapping.interfaceApi.host = localhost
mapping.interfaceApi.source = /interfaces
mapping.interfaceApi.target = /webapp/com.enonic.app.explorer/interfaces/api/v1
mapping.interfaceApi.idProvider.system = default
----

== Endpoints

I'm using the vhost configuration above as basis for the example urls below.

I'm also assuming a valid Authorization is provided.

=== REST

==== interfaces

If you visit *http://localhost:8080/interfaces* you will get a list of the interface GraphQL endpoint you can use.

=== GraphQL

==== interface_name

Use a tool like GraphiQL to connect to the *http://localhost:8080/interfaces/interface/interface_name* GraphQL endpoint,
read the autogenerated GraphQL documentation,
and experiment with queries you can use when you implement an <<../clients#, Explorer client>>.
